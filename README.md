## My Engineering Principles

- **Simple is secure**: tools should reduce friction and increase clarity.
- **Composable**: build once, reuse everywhere.
- **Fail smart**: everything should break safely and log why.
- **Purpose > Buzzwords**: I don‚Äôt chase trends. I solve problems.

Our biggest weakness is what we don't know. I work across cybersecurity, automation, and data to close those gaps by designing tools that make risk visible, compliance clear, and decisions easier to act on. My focus is clarity, precision, and protection in every tool I build.
