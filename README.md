# about-me

I'm a builder at the intersection of cybersecurity, data engineering, and automation. I design tools and systems that simplify risk management, streamline compliance, and make security workflows more effective — especially in environments where speed, clarity, and trust matter.

## Development Approach

I aim to create:
- Tools that are useful and usable
- Reports that communicate risk clearly
- Projects that solve real-world problems
- Code that's modular, tested, and adaptable
